## Overview

This project is a ReactJS implementation of a mock-up for the Twitter profile page of ReactJS. It's designed as part of a learning exercise for an internship program at Foothill Technology Solutions. The goal was to recreate the look of the profile page without backend functionality, focusing on frontend skills using ReactJS and Chakra UI.

## Features

- **Reusability**: Components are built to be reusable across different parts of the application.
- **Responsiveness**: The layout adjusts to fit various screen sizes ensuring a consistent experience across devices.
- **Component-Based**: Utilizes the power of ReactJS to manage the UI in a modular, efficient manner.
